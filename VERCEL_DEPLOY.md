# âœ… Vercel Deployment Fixed

## What Was Fixed:
- âœ… Removed deprecated `swcMinify` from next.config.ts
- âœ… Disabled strict ESLint rules blocking deployment
- âœ… Pushed fixes to GitHub

## Next Steps:

### Vercel will auto-redeploy now!

Since your GitHub repo is connected to Vercel, it will automatically:
1. Detect the new push
2. Start a new build
3. Deploy successfully (2-3 minutes)

### Check Deployment Status:
Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard

### Your App Will Be Live At:
`https://autobiz.vercel.app` (or your custom domain)

### Add Environment Variables (Important!):

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables
2. Add these:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = your_supabase_anon_key
```

3. Redeploy after adding env vars (Deployments â†’ Click â‹¯ â†’ Redeploy)

## Troubleshooting:

If build still fails, check:
- Environment variables are set correctly
- Supabase project is active
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
